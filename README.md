# JPsTale-Asset
Import old 3dmax ASE format into jme3 games.

This plugin it made for game JPsTale, it's a Java version of an old game named Priston Tale. Since the game use 3dsmax ASE model, I made a new plugin to import them into jME3.
Now I decide to create more plugins to import 3dsmax models into jME3, and this one it renamed from JPsTale-AsePlugin to jME3-MaxAsePlugin.
